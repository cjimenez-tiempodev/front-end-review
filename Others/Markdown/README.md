#Markdown

**Markdown is a way to style text on the web**    
Hereâ€™s an overview of Markdown syntax that you can use anywhere on GitHub.com    

* **Text**

*This text will be italic*
> start, end *   
_This will also be italic_
> start, end _   
**This text will be bold**
> start, end two **    
__This will also be bold__
> start, end two __   
_You **can** combine them_
> _ * text * _    

* **List**

Numbered lists:

1. One
2. Two
3. Three

Bullet points:

* Start a line with a star
* Profit!

Alternatively,

- Dashes work just as well
- And if you have sub points, put two spaces before the dash or star:
  - Sub point 1
  - Sub point 2

* **Headers & Quotes**    

# Structured documents

Different levels starts lines with a `#` to create headings. Multiple `##` in a row denote smaller heading sizes.

### This is a third-tier heading

You can use one `#` all the way up to `######` six for different heading sizes.

To quote use the > character before the line:

> Coffee. The finest organic suspension ever devised... I beat the Borg with it.
> - Captain Janeway

* **Code**    


* **Extras**
