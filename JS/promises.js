/*
The Promise object represents the eventual completion (or failure) of an asynchronous operation, and its resulting value.

Promises have a then(..) method that accepts one or two callback functions.
The first function (if present) is treated as the handler to call if the promise is fulfilled successfully.
The second function (if present) is treated as the handler to call if the promise is rejected explicitly,
or if any error/exception is caught during resolution.

The Promise API also provides some static methods for working with Promises.

/*
A Promise is in one of these states:

pending: initial state, neither fulfilled nor rejected.
fulfilled: meaning that the operation completed successfully.
rejected: meaning that the operation failed.

Methods

Promise.all()
Returns a promise that either fulfills when all of the promises in the iterable argument have fulfilled or
rejects as soon as one of the promises in the iterable argument rejects.

Promise.race()
Returns a promise that fulfills or rejects as soon as one of the promises in the iterable fulfills or rejects,
with the value or reason from that promise.

Promise prototype

Promise.prototype.finally()
Appends a handler to the promise, and returns a new promise which is resolved when the original promise is resolved
